              What is Sign Language?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Sign language is a sophisticated visual form of communication that uses hand gestures, facial expressions, 
              and body language to convey meaning. Unlike spoken languages, sign languages are three-dimensional, 
              utilizing space and movement to create grammar and meaning. Each sign language has its own unique 
              structure, grammar rules, and cultural context, making it as rich and complex as any spoken language.

              The Importance of Sign Language
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Sign language is not just a tool for communication; it's a fundamental human right that ensures deaf and 
              hard of hearing individuals can fully participate in society. It provides a means of expression, education, 
              and connection within both deaf and hearing communities. Learning sign language promotes inclusivity and 
              breaks down barriers between deaf and hearing individuals, creating a more accessible and understanding world.
